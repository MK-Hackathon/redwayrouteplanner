# Redway Route Planner

Many people expressed a wish to use the redway more, both for environmental and personal reasons, but noted that they had difficulty navigating the redways, planning a route, knowing fun places to visit and knowing where were the safest places to go.

The app will have:
- Map of the redway routes - possibly driven by the API of the openstreetmap or Google Maps API
- Information on the location of great places to visit in Milton Keynes
- Information on bike lock-up points around CMK
- Average busyness, crime statistics and speed of travel on certain paths
- A route planner with lots of filtering to give you the coolest routes

Some of the APIs/libraries we're thinking of using are:
- https://developers.google.com/maps/
- https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper
- https://apidocs.os.uk/docs/introduction
- https://datahub.mksmart.org/entity-lookup/
